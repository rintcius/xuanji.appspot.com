<h2> A Register-Machine Simulator </h2> 

In order to gain a good understanding of the design of register machines, we
must test the machines we design to see if they perform as expected.  One way
to test a design is to hand-simulate the operation of the controller, as in
Exercise 5-5.  But this is extremely tedious for all but the simplest
machines.  In this section we construct a simulator for machines described in
the register-machine language.  The simulator is a Scheme program with four
interface procedures.  The first uses a description of a register machine to
construct a model of the machine (a data structure whose parts correspond to
the parts of the machine to be simulated), and the other three allow us to
simulate the machine by manipulating the model:

<div class="exercise">

<div id="">
(make-machine <register-names> <operations> <controller>)
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>


constructs and returns a model of the machine with the given registers,
operations, and controller.

<div id="">
(set-register-contents! <machine-model> <register-name> <value>)
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>


stores a value in a simulated register in the given machine.

<div id="">
(get-register-contents <machine-model> <register-name>)
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>


returns the contents of a simulated register in the given machine.

<div id="">
(start <machine-model>)
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>


simulates the execution of the given machine, starting from the beginning of
the controller sequence and stopping when it reaches the end of the sequence.
</div>

As an example of how these procedures are used, we can define
<tt> gcd-machine </tt> to be a model of the @acronym{GCD} machine of section
5-1-1 as follows:

<div id="">
(define gcd-machine
  (make-machine
   '(a b t)
   (list (list 'rem remainder) (list '= =))
   '(test-b
       (test (op =) (reg b) (const 0))
       (branch (label gcd-done))
       (assign t (op rem) (reg a) (reg b))
       (assign a (reg b))
       (assign b (reg t))
       (goto (label test-b))
     gcd-done)))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

The first argument to <tt> make-machine </tt> is a list of register names.  The
next argument is a table (a list of two-element lists) that pairs each
operation name with a Scheme procedure that implements the operation (that is,
produces the same output value given the same input values).  The last argument
specifies the controller as a list of labels and machine instructions, as in
section 5-1.

To compute @acronym{GCD}s with this machine, we set the input registers, start
the machine, and examine the result when the simulation terminates:

<div id="">
(set-register-contents! gcd-machine 'a 206)
done

(set-register-contents! gcd-machine 'b 40)
done

(start gcd-machine)
done

(get-register-contents gcd-machine 'a)
2
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

This computation will run much more slowly than a <tt> gcd </tt> procedure written
in Scheme, because we will simulate low-level machine instructions, such as
<tt> assign </tt>, by much more complex operations.

<div class="exercise">
<b>Exercise 5.7:</b> Use the simulator to test the
machines you designed in Exercise 5-4.

<h3> The Machine Model </h3> 

The machine model generated by <tt> make-machine </tt> is represented as a
procedure with local state using the message-passing techniques developed in
Chapter 3.  To build this model, <tt> make-machine </tt> begins by calling
the procedure <tt> make-new-machine </tt> to construct the parts of the machine
model that are common to all register machines.  This basic machine model
constructed by <tt> make-new-machine </tt> is essentially a container for some
registers and a stack, together with an execution mechanism that processes the
controller instructions one by one.

<tt> Make-machine </tt> then extends this basic model (by sending it messages) to
include the registers, operations, and controller of the particular machine
being defined.  First it allocates a register in the new machine for each of
the supplied register names and installs the designated operations in the
machine.  Then it uses an <tt> assembler </tt> 
 (described below in section
5-2-2) to transform the controller list into instructions for the new
machine and installs these as the machine's instruction sequence.
<tt> Make-machine </tt> returns as its value the modified machine model.

<div id="">
(define (make-machine register-names ops controller-text)
  (let ((machine (make-new-machine)))
    (for-each (lambda (register-name)
                ((machine 'allocate-register) register-name))
              register-names)
    ((machine 'install-operations) ops)
    ((machine 'install-instruction-sequence)
     (assemble controller-text machine))
    machine))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<h4> Registers </h4> 

We will represent a register as a procedure with local state, as in
Chapter 3.  The procedure <tt> make-register </tt> creates a register that
holds a value that can be accessed or changed:

<div id="">
(define (make-register name)
  (let ((contents '*unassigned*))
    (define (dispatch message)
      (cond ((eq? message 'get) contents)
            ((eq? message 'set)
             (lambda (value) (set! contents value)))
            (else
             (error "Unknown request -- REGISTER" message))))
    dispatch))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

The following procedures are used to access registers:

<div id="">
(define (get-contents register)
  (register 'get))

(define (set-contents! register value)
  ((register 'set) value))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<h4> The stack </h4> 

We can also represent a stack as a procedure with local state.  The procedure
<tt> make-stack </tt> creates a stack whose local state consists of a list of the
items on the stack.  A stack accepts requests to <tt> push </tt> an item onto the
stack, to <tt> pop </tt> the top item off the stack and return it, and to
<tt> initialize </tt> the stack to empty.

<div id="">
(define (make-stack)
  (let ((s '()))
    (define (push x)
      (set! s (cons x s)))
    (define (pop)
      (if (null? s)
          (error "Empty stack -- POP")
          (let ((top (car s)))
            (set! s (cdr s))
            top)))
    (define (initialize)
      (set! s '())
      'done)
    (define (dispatch message)
      (cond ((eq? message 'push) push)
            ((eq? message 'pop) (pop))
            ((eq? message 'initialize) (initialize))
            (else (error "Unknown request -- STACK"
                         message))))
    dispatch))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

The following procedures are used to access stacks:

<div id="">
(define (pop stack)
  (stack 'pop))

(define (push stack value)
  ((stack 'push) value))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<h4> The basic machine </h4> 

The <tt> make-new-machine </tt> procedure, shown in Figure 5-13, constructs
an object whose local state consists of a stack, an initially empty instruction
sequence, a list of operations that initially contains an operation to
initialize the stack, and a <tt> register table </tt> 
 that initially contains
two registers, named <tt> flag </tt> and <tt> pc </tt> (for ``program counter'').  The
internal procedure <tt> allocate-register </tt> adds new entries to the register
table, and the internal procedure <tt> lookup-register </tt> looks up registers in
the table.

The <tt> flag </tt> register is used to control branching in the simulated machine.
<tt> Test </tt> instructions set the contents of <tt> flag </tt> to the result of the
test (true or false).  <tt> Branch </tt> instructions decide whether or not to
branch by examining the contents of <tt> flag </tt>.

The <tt> pc </tt> register determines the sequencing of instructions as the machine
runs.  This sequencing is implemented by the internal procedure <tt> execute </tt>.
In the simulation model, each machine instruction is a data structure that
includes a procedure of no arguments, called the <tt> instruction execution
procedure </tt> 
, such that calling this procedure simulates executing the
instruction.  As the simulation runs, <tt> pc </tt> points to the place in the
instruction sequence beginning with the next instruction to be executed.
<tt> Execute </tt> gets that instruction, executes it by calling the instruction
execution procedure, and repeats this cycle until there are no more
instructions to execute (i.e., until <tt> pc </tt> points to the end of the
instruction sequence).

               (execute))
              ((eq? message 'install-instruction-sequence)
               (lambda (seq) (set! the-instruction-sequence seq)))

              ((eq? message 'get-register) lookup-register)

@end smalllisp
</div>

As part of its operation, each instruction execution procedure modifies
<tt> pc </tt> to indicate the next instruction to be executed.  <tt> Branch </tt> and
<tt> goto </tt> instructions change <tt> pc </tt> to point to the new destination.  All
other instructions simply advance <tt> pc </tt>, making it point to the next
instruction in the sequence.  Observe that each call to <tt> execute </tt> calls
<tt> execute </tt> again, but this does not produce an infinite loop because
running the instruction execution procedure changes the contents of <tt> pc </tt>.

<tt> Make-new-machine </tt> returns a <tt> dispatch </tt> procedure that implements
message-passing access to the internal state.  Notice that starting the machine
is accomplished by setting <tt> pc </tt> to the beginning of the instruction
sequence and calling <tt> execute </tt>.

For convenience, we provide an alternate procedural interface to a machine's
<tt> start </tt> operation, as well as procedures to set and examine register
contents, as specified at the beginning of section 5-2:

<div id="">
(define (start machine)
  (machine 'start))

(define (get-register-contents machine register-name)
  (get-contents (get-register machine register-name)))

(define (set-register-contents! machine register-name value)
  (set-contents! (get-register machine register-name) value)
  'done)
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

These procedures (and many procedures in sections 5-2-2 and 5-2-3)
use the following to look up the register with a given name in a given machine:

<div id="">
(define (get-register machine reg-name)
  ((machine 'get-register) reg-name))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<h3> The Assembler </h3> 

The assembler transforms the sequence of controller expressions for a machine
into a corresponding list of machine instructions, each with its execution
procedure.  Overall, the assembler is much like the evaluators we studied in
Chapter 4---there is an input language (in this case, the
register-machine language) and we must perform an appropriate action for each
type of expression in the language.

The technique of producing an execution procedure for each instruction is just
what we used in section 4-1-7 to speed up the evaluator by separating
analysis from runtime execution.  As we saw in Chapter 4, much useful
analysis of Scheme expressions could be performed without knowing the actual
values of variables.  Here, analogously, much useful analysis of
register-machine-language expressions can be performed without knowing the
actual contents of machine registers.  For example, we can replace references
to registers by pointers to the register objects, and we can replace references
to labels by pointers to the place in the instruction sequence that the label
designates.

Before it can generate the instruction execution procedures, the assembler must
know what all the labels refer to, so it begins by scanning the controller text
to separate the labels from the instructions.  As it scans the text, it
constructs both a list of instructions and a table that associates each label
with a pointer into that list.  Then the assembler augments the instruction
list by inserting the execution procedure for each instruction.

The <tt> assemble </tt> procedure is the main entry to the assembler.  It takes the
controller text and the machine model as arguments and returns the instruction
sequence to be stored in the model.  <tt> Assemble </tt> calls
<tt> extract-labels </tt> to build the initial instruction list and label table
from the supplied controller text.  The second argument to
<tt> extract-labels </tt> is a procedure to be called to process these results:
This procedure uses <tt> update-insts! </tt> to generate the instruction execution
procedures and insert them into the instruction list, and returns the modified
list.

<div id="">
(define (assemble controller-text machine)
  (extract-labels controller-text
    (lambda (insts labels)
      (update-insts! insts labels machine)
      insts)))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<tt> Extract-labels </tt> takes as arguments a list <tt> text </tt> (the sequence of
controller instruction expressions) and a <tt> receive </tt> procedure.
<tt> Receive </tt> will be called with two values: (1) a list <tt> insts </tt> of
instruction data structures, each containing an instruction from <tt> text </tt>;
and (2) a table called <tt> labels </tt>, which associates each label from
<tt> text </tt> with the position in the list <tt> insts </tt> that the label
designates.

<div id="">
(define (extract-labels text receive)
  (if (null? text)
      (receive '() '())
      (extract-labels (cdr text)
       (lambda (insts labels)
         (let ((next-inst (car text)))
           (if (symbol? next-inst)
               (receive insts
                        (cons (make-label-entry next-inst
                                                insts)
                              labels))
               (receive (cons (make-instruction next-inst)
                              insts)
                        labels)))))))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<tt> Extract-labels </tt> works by sequentially scanning the elements of the
<tt> text </tt> and accumulating the <tt> insts </tt> and the <tt> labels </tt>.  If an
element is a symbol (and thus a label) an appropriate entry is added to the
<tt> labels </tt> table.  Otherwise the element is accumulated onto the
<tt> insts </tt> list.@footnote{Using the <tt> receive </tt> procedure here is a way to
get <tt> extract-labels </tt> to effectively return two values---<tt> labels </tt> and
<tt> insts </tt>---without explicitly making a compound data structure to hold
them.  An alternative implementation, which returns an explicit pair of values,
is

<div id="">
(define (extract-labels text)
  (if (null? text)
      (cons '() '())
      (let ((result (extract-labels (cdr text))))
        (let ((insts (car result)) (labels (cdr result)))
          (let ((next-inst (car text)))
            (if (symbol? next-inst)
                (cons insts
                      (cons (make-label-entry next-inst insts) labels))
                (cons (cons (make-instruction next-inst) insts)
                      labels)))))))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>


which would be called by <tt> assemble </tt> as follows:

<div id="">
(define (assemble controller-text machine)
  (let ((result (extract-labels controller-text)))
    (let ((insts (car result)) (labels (cdr result)))
      (update-insts! insts labels machine)
      insts)))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

You can consider our use of <tt> receive </tt> as demonstrating an elegant way to
return multiple values, or simply an excuse to show off a programming trick.
An argument like <tt> receive </tt> that is the next procedure to be invoked is
called a ``continuation.''  Recall that we also used continuations to implement
the backtracking control structure in the <tt> amb </tt> evaluator in section
4-3-3.}

<tt> Update-insts! </tt> modifies the instruction list, which initially contains
only the text of the instructions, to include the corresponding execution
procedures:

<div id="">
(define (update-insts! insts labels machine)
  (let ((pc (get-register machine 'pc))
        (flag (get-register machine 'flag))
        (stack (machine 'stack))
        (ops (machine 'operations)))
    (for-each
     (lambda (inst)
       (set-instruction-execution-proc!
        inst
        (make-execution-procedure
         (instruction-text inst) labels machine
         pc flag stack ops)))
     insts)))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

The machine instruction data structure simply pairs the instruction text with
the corresponding execution procedure.  The execution procedure is not yet
available when <tt> extract-labels </tt> constructs the instruction, and is
inserted later by <tt> update-insts! </tt>.

<div id="">
(define (make-instruction text)
  (cons text '()))

(define (instruction-text inst)
  (car inst))

(define (instruction-execution-proc inst)
  (cdr inst))

(define (set-instruction-execution-proc! inst proc)
  (set-cdr! inst proc))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

The instruction text is not used by our simulator, but it is handy to keep
around for debugging (see Exercise 5-16).

Elements of the label table are pairs:

<div id="">
(define (make-label-entry label-name insts)
  (cons label-name insts))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

Entries will be looked up in the table with

<div id="">
(define (lookup-label labels label-name)
  (let ((val (assoc label-name labels)))
    (if val
        (cdr val)
        (error "Undefined label -- ASSEMBLE" label-name))))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<div class="exercise">
<b>Exercise 5.8:</b> The following register-machine code
is ambiguous, because the label <tt> here </tt> is defined more than once:

<div id="">
start
  (goto (label here))
here
  (assign a (const 3))
  (goto (label there))
here
  (assign a (const 4))
  (goto (label there))

</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

With the simulator as written, what will the contents of register <tt> a </tt> be
when control reaches <tt> there </tt>?  Modify the <tt> extract-labels </tt> procedure
so that the assembler will signal an error if the same label name is used to
indicate two different locations.
</div>

<h3> Generating Execution Procedures for Instructions </h3> 

The assembler calls <tt> make-execution-procedure </tt> to generate the execution
procedure for an instruction.  Like the <tt> analyze </tt> procedure in the
evaluator of section 4-1-7, this dispatches on the type of instruction to
generate the appropriate execution procedure.

<div id="">

  (cond ((eq? (car inst) 'assign)
         (make-assign inst machine labels ops pc))
        ((eq? (car inst) 'test)
         (make-test inst machine labels ops flag pc))
        ((eq? (car inst) 'branch)
         (make-branch inst machine labels flag pc))
        ((eq? (car inst) 'goto)

For each type of instruction in the register-machine language, there is a
generator that builds an appropriate execution procedure.  The details of these
procedures determine both the syntax and meaning of the individual instructions
in the register-machine language.  We use data abstraction to isolate the
detailed syntax of register-machine expressions from the general execution
mechanism, as we did for evaluators in section 4-1-2, by using syntax
procedures to extract and classify the parts of an instruction.

<h4> <tt> Assign </tt> instructions </h4> 

The <tt> make-assign </tt> procedure handles <tt> assign </tt> instructions:

<div id="">
(define (make-assign inst machine labels operations pc)
  (let ((target
         (get-register machine (assign-reg-name inst)))
        (value-exp (assign-value-exp inst)))
    (let ((value-proc
           (if (operation-exp? value-exp)
               (make-operation-exp
                value-exp machine labels operations)
               (make-primitive-exp
                (car value-exp) machine labels))))
      (lambda ()                ; execution procedure for <tt> assign </tt>
        (set-contents! target (value-proc))
        (advance-pc pc)))))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<tt> Make-assign </tt> extracts the target register name (the second element of the
instruction) and the value expression (the rest of the list that forms the
instruction) from the <tt> assign </tt> instruction using the selectors

<div id="">
(define (assign-reg-name assign-instruction)
  (cadr assign-instruction))

(define (assign-value-exp assign-instruction)
  (cddr assign-instruction))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

The register name is looked up with <tt> get-register </tt> to produce the target
register object.  The value expression is passed to <tt> make-operation-exp </tt>
if the value is the result of an operation, and to <tt> make-primitive-exp </tt>
otherwise.  These procedures (shown below) parse the value expression and
produce an execution procedure for the value.  This is a procedure of no
arguments, called <tt> value-proc </tt>, which will be evaluated during the
simulation to produce the actual value to be assigned to the register.  Notice
that the work of looking up the register name and parsing the value expression
is performed just once, at assembly time, not every time the instruction is
simulated.  This saving of work is the reason we use execution procedures, and
corresponds directly to the saving in work we obtained by separating program
analysis from execution in the evaluator of section 4-1-7.

The result returned by <tt> make-assign </tt> is the execution procedure for the
<tt> assign </tt> instruction.  When this procedure is called (by the machine
model's <tt> execute </tt> procedure), it sets the contents of the target register
to the result obtained by executing <tt> value-proc </tt>.  Then it advances the
<tt> pc </tt> to the next instruction by running the procedure

<div id="">
(define (advance-pc pc)
  (set-contents! pc (cdr (get-contents pc))))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<tt> Advance-pc </tt> is the normal termination for all instructions except
<tt> branch </tt> and <tt> goto </tt>.

<h4> <tt> Test </tt>, <tt> branch </tt>, and <tt> goto </tt> instructions </h4> 

<tt> Make-test </tt> handles <tt> test </tt> instructions in a similar way.  It
extracts the expression that specifies the condition to be tested and generates
an execution procedure for it.  At simulation time, the procedure for the
condition is called, the result is assigned to the <tt> flag </tt> register, and
the <tt> pc </tt> is advanced:

<div id="">
(define (make-test inst machine labels operations flag pc)
  (let ((condition (test-condition inst)))
    (if (operation-exp? condition)
        (let ((condition-proc
               (make-operation-exp
                condition machine labels operations)))
          (lambda ()
            (set-contents! flag (condition-proc))
            (advance-pc pc)))
        (error "Bad TEST instruction -- ASSEMBLE" inst))))

(define (test-condition test-instruction)
  (cdr test-instruction))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

The execution procedure for a <tt> branch </tt> instruction checks the contents of
the <tt> flag </tt> register and either sets the contents of the <tt> pc </tt> to the
branch destination (if the branch is taken) or else just advances the <tt> pc </tt>
(if the branch is not taken).  Notice that the indicated destination in a
<tt> branch </tt> instruction must be a label, and the <tt> make-branch </tt> procedure
enforces this.  Notice also that the label is looked up at assembly time, not
each time the <tt> branch </tt> instruction is simulated.

<div id="">
(define (make-branch inst machine labels flag pc)
  (let ((dest (branch-dest inst)))
    (if (label-exp? dest)
        (let ((insts
               (lookup-label labels (label-exp-label dest))))
          (lambda ()
            (if (get-contents flag)
                (set-contents! pc insts)
                (advance-pc pc))))
        (error "Bad BRANCH instruction -- ASSEMBLE" inst))))

(define (branch-dest branch-instruction)
  (cadr branch-instruction))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

A <tt> goto </tt> instruction is similar to a branch, except that the destination
may be specified either as a label or as a register, and there is no condition
to check---the <tt> pc </tt> is always set to the new destination.

<div id="">
(define (make-goto inst machine labels pc)
  (let ((dest (goto-dest inst)))
    (cond ((label-exp? dest)
           (let ((insts
                  (lookup-label labels
                                (label-exp-label dest))))
             (lambda () (set-contents! pc insts))))
          ((register-exp? dest)
           (let ((reg
                  (get-register machine
                                (register-exp-reg dest))))
             (lambda ()
               (set-contents! pc (get-contents reg)))))
          (else (error "Bad GOTO instruction -- ASSEMBLE"
                       inst)))))

(define (goto-dest goto-instruction)
  (cadr goto-instruction))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<h4> Other instructions </h4> 

The stack instructions <tt> save </tt> and <tt> restore </tt> simply use the stack with
the designated register and advance the <tt> pc </tt>:

<div id="">
(define (make-save inst machine stack pc)
  (let ((reg (get-register machine
                           (stack-inst-reg-name inst))))
    (lambda ()
      (push stack (get-contents reg))
      (advance-pc pc))))

(define (make-restore inst machine stack pc)
  (let ((reg (get-register machine
                           (stack-inst-reg-name inst))))
    (lambda ()
      (set-contents! reg (pop stack))
      (advance-pc pc))))

(define (stack-inst-reg-name stack-instruction)
  (cadr stack-instruction))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

The final instruction type, handled by <tt> make-perform </tt>, generates an
execution procedure for the action to be performed.  At simulation time, the
action procedure is executed and the <tt> pc </tt> advanced.

<div id="">
(define (make-perform inst machine labels operations pc)
  (let ((action (perform-action inst)))
    (if (operation-exp? action)
        (let ((action-proc
               (make-operation-exp
                action machine labels operations)))
          (lambda ()
            (action-proc)
            (advance-pc pc)))
        (error "Bad PERFORM instruction -- ASSEMBLE" inst))))

(define (perform-action inst) (cdr inst))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<h4> Execution procedures for subexpressions </h4> 

The value of a <tt> reg </tt>, <tt> label </tt>, or <tt> const </tt> expression may be
needed for assignment to a register (<tt> make-assign </tt>) or for input to an
operation (<tt> make-operation-exp </tt>, below).  The following procedure
generates execution procedures to produce values for these expressions during
the simulation:

<div id="">
(define (make-primitive-exp exp machine labels)
  (cond ((constant-exp? exp)
         (let ((c (constant-exp-value exp)))
           (lambda () c)))
        ((label-exp? exp)
         (let ((insts
                (lookup-label labels
                              (label-exp-label exp))))
           (lambda () insts)))
        ((register-exp? exp)
         (let ((r (get-register machine
                                (register-exp-reg exp))))
           (lambda () (get-contents r))))
        (else
         (error "Unknown expression type -- ASSEMBLE" exp))))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

The syntax of <tt> reg </tt>, <tt> label </tt>, and <tt> const </tt> expressions is
determined by

<div id="">
(define (register-exp? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'reg))

(define (register-exp-reg exp) (cadr exp))

(define (constant-exp? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'const))

(define (constant-exp-value exp) (cadr exp))

(define (label-exp? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'label))

(define (label-exp-label exp) (cadr exp))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<tt> Assign </tt>, <tt> perform </tt>, and <tt> test </tt> instructions may include the
application of a machine operation (specified by an <tt> op </tt> expression) to
some operands (specified by <tt> reg </tt> and <tt> const </tt> expressions).  The
following procedure produces an execution procedure for an ``operation
expression''---a list containing the operation and operand expressions from the
instruction:

<div id="">
(define (make-operation-exp exp machine labels operations)
  (let ((op (lookup-prim (operation-exp-op exp) operations))
        (aprocs
         (map (lambda (e)
                (make-primitive-exp e machine labels))
              (operation-exp-operands exp))))
    (lambda ()
      (apply op (map (lambda (p) (p)) aprocs)))))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

The syntax of operation expressions is determined by

<div id="">
(define (operation-exp? exp)
  (and (pair? exp) (tagged-list? (car exp) 'op)))

(define (operation-exp-op operation-exp)
  (cadr (car operation-exp)))

(define (operation-exp-operands operation-exp)
  (cdr operation-exp))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

Observe that the treatment of operation expressions is very much like the
treatment of procedure applications by the <tt> analyze-application </tt> procedure
in the evaluator of section 4-1-7 in that we generate an execution
procedure for each operand.  At simulation time, we call the operand procedures
and apply the Scheme procedure that simulates the operation to the resulting
values.  The simulation procedure is found by looking up the operation name in
the operation table for the machine:

<div id="">
(define (lookup-prim symbol operations)
  (let ((val (assoc symbol operations)))
    (if val
        (cadr val)
        (error "Unknown operation -- ASSEMBLE" symbol))))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

<div class="exercise">
<b>Exercise 5.9:</b> The treatment of machine operations
above permits them to operate on labels as well as on constants and the
contents of registers.  Modify the expression-processing procedures to enforce
the condition that operations can be used only with registers and constants.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<b>Exercise 5.10:</b> Design a new syntax for
register-machine instructions and modify the simulator to use your new syntax.
Can you implement your new syntax without changing any part of the simulator
except the syntax procedures in this section?
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<b>Exercise 5.11:</b> When we introduced <tt> save </tt>
and <tt> restore </tt> in section 5-1-4, we didn't specify what would happen
if you tried to restore a register that was not the last one saved, as in the
sequence

<div id="">
(save y)
(save x)
(restore y)
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

There are several reasonable possibilities for the meaning of <tt> restore </tt>:

<ul>
@item
<tt> (restore y) </tt> puts into <tt> y </tt> the last value saved on the stack,
regardless of what register that value came from.  This is the way our
simulator behaves.  Show how to take advantage of this behavior to eliminate
one instruction from the Fibonacci machine of section 5-1-4 (Figure
5-12).

@item
<tt> (restore y) </tt> puts into <tt> y </tt> the last value saved on the stack, but
only if that value was saved from <tt> y </tt>; otherwise, it signals an error.
Modify the simulator to behave this way.  You will have to change <tt> save </tt>
to put the register name on the stack along with the value.

@item
<tt> (restore y) </tt> puts into <tt> y </tt> the last value saved from <tt> y </tt>
regardless of what other registers were saved after <tt> y </tt> and not restored.
Modify the simulator to behave this way.  You will have to associate a separate

(<tt> assign </tt>, <tt> goto </tt>, and so on);

@item
a list (without duplicates) of the registers used to hold entry points (these

<h3> Monitoring Machine Performance </h3> 

Simulation is useful not only for verifying the correctness of a proposed
machine design but also for measuring the machine's performance.  For example,
we can install in our simulation program a ``meter'' that measures the number
of stack operations used in a computation.  To do this, we modify our simulated
stack to keep track of the number of times registers are saved on the stack and
the maximum depth reached by the stack, and add a message to the stack's
interface that prints the statistics, as shown below.  We also add an operation
to the basic machine model to print the stack statistics, by initializing
<tt> the-ops </tt> in <tt> make-new-machine </tt> to

<div id="">
(list (list 'initialize-stack
            (lambda () (stack 'initialize)))
      (list 'print-stack-statistics
            (lambda () (stack 'print-statistics))))
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>

Here is the new version of <tt> make-stack </tt>:

<div id="">
(define (make-stack)
  (let ((s '())
        (number-pushes 0)
        (max-depth 0)
        (current-depth 0))
    (define (push x)
      (set! s (cons x s))
      (set! number-pushes (+ 1 number-pushes))
      (set! current-depth (+ 1 current-depth))
      (set! max-depth (max current-depth max-depth)))
    (define (pop)
      (if (null? s)
          (error "Empty stack -- POP")
          (let ((top (car s)))
            (set! s (cdr s))
            (set! current-depth (- current-depth 1))
            top)))
    (define (initialize)
      (set! s '())
      (set! number-pushes 0)
      (set! max-depth 0)

Exercise 5-15 through Exercise 5-19 describe other useful
monitoring and debugging features that can be added to the register-machine
simulator.

<div class="exercise">
<b>Exercise 5.14:</b> Measure the number of pushes and
the maximum stack depth required to compute n! for various small values of
n using the factorial machine shown in Figure 5-11.  From your data
determine formulas in terms of n for the total number of push operations

that each of these is a linear function of n and is thus determined by two
constants.  In order to get the statistics printed, you will have to augment
the factorial machine with instructions to initialize the stack and print the
statistics.  You may want to also modify the machine so that it repeatedly
reads a value for n, computes the factorial, and prints the result (as we
did for the @acronym{GCD} machine in Figure 5-4), so that you will not
have to repeatedly invoke <tt> get-register-contents </tt>,
<tt> set-register-contents! </tt>, and <tt> start </tt>.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<b>Exercise 5.15:</b> Add <tt> instruction
counting </tt> 
 to the register machine simulation.  That is, have the machine model
keep track of the number of instructions executed.  Extend the machine model's

count and resets the count to zero.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<b>Exercise 5.16:</b> Augment the simulator to provide

tracing on and off.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<b>Exercise 5.17:</b> Extend the instruction tracing of
Exercise 5-16 so that before printing an instruction, the simulator
prints any labels that immediately precede that instruction in the controller

instruction counting (Exercise 5-15).  You will have to make the
simulator retain the necessary label information.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<b>Exercise 5.18:</b> Modify the <tt> make-register </tt>

register, the old contents of the register, and the new contents being
assigned.  Extend the interface to the machine model to permit you to turn
tracing on and off for designated machine registers.

<b>Exercise 5.19:</b> Alyssa P. Hacker wants a

stop and allow her to examine the state of the machine.  You are to implement a
procedure

<div id="">

that sets a breakpoint just before the nth instruction after the given
label.  For example,

<div id="">
(set-breakpoint gcd-machine 'test-b 4)
</div>
<script>
prompt();
</script>


installs a breakpoint in <tt> gcd-machine </tt> just before the assignment to
register <tt> a </tt>.  When the simulator reaches the breakpoint it should print
the label and the offset of the breakpoint and stop executing instructions.
Alyssa can then use <tt> get-register-contents </tt> and

She should then be able to continue execution by saying
